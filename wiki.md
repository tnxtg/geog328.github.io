**Marvel Rivals** is a free-to-play shooter game I have recently been interested in that was released on December 6th, 2024. Marvel Rivals has playable characters from the Marvel Universe such as Spiderman, Hulk, Captain America, etc. This document will showcase the characters I enjoy playing and what I like about the game!

## Roles
To begin, I will first talk about the three roles in Marvel Rivals: Vanguards, Duelists and Strategists. Vanguards are heroes designed to be at the frontlines with their greater health pools to endure and absorb damage to take space. Duelists are heroes designed to deal large amounts of damage and secure takedowns on the opposing team. Strategists are heroes designed to support their teammates by healing or providing buffs such as movement speeds or hitting enemies with debuffs.

## What is my favorite role to play?
My favorite role to play is Duelist!
### Moon Knight

[Moon Knight](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Knight) is one of my go-to characters to play in Marvel Rivals! He is a long ranged character with great mobility such as a grappling hook, gliding when in the air, and a double jump. The most satisfying part of his skill sets is his ability to throw out ankhs. The ankhs pulls enemies in towards wherever it is thrown and whenever Moon Knight shoots the ankh, his projectiles ricochet onto the enemies.
### Psylocke

[Psylocke](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Psylocke) is my second favorite duelist to play in Marvel Rivals! Psylocke is very different compared to Moon Knight as she is a close to mid range assassin that gets close to the enemies to flank them. Psylocke has even greater mobility then Moon Knight because she has access to two dashes and the ability to gain movement speed while invisible. The most satisfying part of Psylocke to me is her ability to eliminate enemy strategist in an instant and get out to safety providing an advantage for her team.

## What other characters do I enjoy playing?
Outside of the duelist role, I also play certain vanguards and strategists that are really fun to me! Although I won't go into to much depth here, my favorite strategists to play are [Jeff the Land Shark](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_the_Land_Shark) and [Cloak & Dagger](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak_%26_Dagger). My favorite vanguards to play are [Doctor Strange](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Strange), [Peni Parker](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Peni_Parker) and [Magneto](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Magneto) but I also enjoy learning other vanguards recently such as [Groot](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Groot) and [Thor](https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Thor).
